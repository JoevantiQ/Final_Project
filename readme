# Blog Application

This blog application is built using Flask and allows a user to create, edit, and delete blog posts after logging in.
The homepage displays all posts in reverse chronological order, including the title, content, author, and date.
Users can log in through the `/login` page, which grants access to a personal dashboard.
From the dashboard, users can manage their own posts by creating new entries, editing existing ones, or deleting them entirely.
Each post is stored in a database along with the author's ID and timestamp of creation.
The application uses Flask-Login for user authentication and SQLAlchemy as the ORM for database operations.
Passwords are securely hashed, and access to editing or deleting posts is restricted to the original author.
username is admin & password is admin
The project includes HTML templates for all pages, rendered with Jinja2.
To run it, install the required libraries, start the app, and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.
